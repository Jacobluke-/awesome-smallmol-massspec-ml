The generative deep learning methods are categorized as SMILES string generator, molecular graph generator, and molecular conformation generator. It is worth noting that the differences between the second and the third categories are for molecular graphs only the atom type and the connections (also known as bonds) are predicted while for the conformations the $x,y,z$-coordinates of the atoms are predicted.
