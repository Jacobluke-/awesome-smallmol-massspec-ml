# Molecular Related Papers & Codes

Updating the newest molecular representation learning methods... Welcome to update the list together! 

Collecting rules: 

1. Papers without any implementation codes are excluded from this list. 

2. Format: 

```markdown
- [conference/journal name year] <MLA cite> [[paper]]() [[code]]() 
```

3. Don't aim to collect all the papers, but high-quality papers.
